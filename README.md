Hello!

My name is Hayden, and I am a Coding Temple software engineering student. This is my very first fully functioning responsive HTML/CSS website design for my module assignment. 
It is meant to show my ability to create a responsive layout, my understanding of semantic HTML, and CSS principles. I opted to use flexbox over grid in an effort to keep the design 
as simplistic as possible. Being my first complete website, I will be continuing to work on this for the next couple of weeks, and making improvements, as this is my first portfolio project. I have a quickly approaching deadline, so v1.0 is simply to meet my project requirements. 

If you have any tips, notes, or comments on things I can try out to improve the website, please feel free to reach out! I want to be the best full-stack developer I can be, and am open to "constructive" criticism.

*The mobile menu is non-functioning for now, and is purely meant to show the header is responsive. Functionallity will later be added, as JavaScript is the next module.
